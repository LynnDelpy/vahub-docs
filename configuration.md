# Configuration

One file configures the hub: `vahub.yaml`. It holds the runtime settings, the language model, the
budgets, the policy that authorizes every action, and the scheduled routines. Module manifests live
outside it, one file per module, written by `vahub module add`.

`vahub init` writes a starting file for you. `vahub doctor` validates it, along with every installed
manifest, without starting anything.

## Where the file is read from

In order:

1. `$VAHUB_CONFIG`, if set.
2. `./vahub.yaml`, if it exists.
3. `/etc/vahub/vahub.yaml`.

If none of these exist the hub runs on built-in defaults, which is a working configuration that can hold
a conversation and do nothing else (the policy denies everything and no modules are installed).

## Precedence

Lowest to highest:

```
built-in defaults  <  vahub.yaml  <  VAHUB_* environment variables  <  chosen in the web UI
```

Environment overrides exist for container deployments, where injecting one variable is easier than
templating a file. They apply to scalar values only. That is deliberate: nobody should be expressing a
policy rule as an environment variable.

The last step is narrow and applies to one thing: which model answers, listens and speaks. An admin can
set that under Settings, Models, and the choice is stored in the database rather than written back into
your file, so the file stays yours and stays the source of truth for everything else. See
[choosing a model](#choosing-a-model-without-editing-the-file).

## Strictness

Loading is strict. An unknown key is an error, not a silently ignored typo, and the hub refuses to
start. A misspelled `origin_allowlist` that quietly became an empty list would be a fail-open default,
and a policy section with a typo in it would be a policy you do not have.

Errors name the offending path and the file:

```
/etc/vahub/vahub.yaml is not valid:
  web.port: Input should be less than or equal to 65535
  policy.rules.homeassistant.light_turn_on.constraints.entity_id.matches: invalid regex
```

Regexes in policy constraints are compiled at load time for this reason. A broken pattern stops the hub
at startup rather than at the moment the rule is first exercised.

## Secrets

Secrets are never written into the file. Any string value may reference the environment or a file, and
the reference is expanded before validation:

```yaml
llm:
  api_key: ${VAHUB_LLM_API_KEY}            # from the environment
  # api_key: ${file:/run/secrets/llm_key}  # from a file, contents stripped
  # api_key: ${VAHUB_LLM_API_KEY:-}        # with a default when unset
```

* `${NAME}` reads an environment variable. If it is unset and no default is given, loading fails with a
  message naming the variable. Silently substituting an empty API key produces a confusing failure much
  later.
* `${NAME:-fallback}` uses `fallback` when `NAME` is unset.
* `${file:/path}` reads the file and strips surrounding whitespace. This is the form to use with systemd
  credentials, Docker secrets and Kubernetes secrets, all of which present a secret as a file. An
  unreadable path is an error.

References work anywhere a string appears, not only in `api_key`, and several can appear in one value.

## Environment overrides

An override is `VAHUB_` plus the path to a scalar, with `__` separating levels:

```bash
VAHUB_WEB__PORT=9000              # web.port
VAHUB_HUB__LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG        # hub.log_level
VAHUB_SPEECH__STT__PROVIDER=none  # speech.stt.provider
VAHUB_LLM__MODEL=gpt-4o-mini      # llm.model
```

Only variables whose first segment names an actual top-level section (`hub`, `web`, `llm`, `budgets`,
`speech`, `policy`, `schedules`) are treated as overrides. That distinction matters, because secrets are
referenced from the config and therefore exist in the environment too. `VAHUB_LLM_API_KEY` (one
underscore) is a secret you reference with `${VAHUB_LLM_API_KEY}`; `VAHUB_LLM__API_KEY` (two) is an
override that sets `llm.api_key` directly. Both work. Only the second is parsed as a config path.

Values are coerced: `true` and `false` become booleans, `null`, `none` and `~` become null, integers and
floats are parsed as numbers, a value starting with `[` or `{` is parsed as JSON, and anything else
stays a string. `VAHUB_CONFIG` is never treated as an override.

## Sections

### hub

```yaml
hub:
  log_level: INFO          # DEBUG | INFO | WARNING | ERROR
  log_format: json         # json | console
  timezone: Europe/Zurich  # used by the scheduler and by daily budgets
  state_dir: /var/lib/vahub
  modules_dir: /etc/vahub/modules.d
```

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `log_level` | `INFO` | |
| `log_format` | `json` | `console` is readable output for a terminal |
| `timezone` | `UTC` | An IANA name. Cron routines fire in this zone, and the daily token budget resets at its midnight |
| `state_dir` | `/var/lib/vahub` | The database, module virtualenvs and other runtime state. The database is `<state_dir>/vahub.db` and is not separately configurable |
| `modules_dir` | `/etc/vahub/modules.d` | Where `vahub module add` writes manifests, and where the supervisor discovers them |

For a non-root install, point both directories somewhere you own:

```yaml
hub:
  state_dir: ~/.local/state/vahub
  modules_dir: ~/.config/vahub/modules.d
```

### web

```yaml
web:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
  origin_allowlist: ["http://localhost:8080"]
  auth_subject_header: X-Auth-Subject
```

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | `127.0.0.1` | Loopback by default. The hub has no authentication of its own, so binding it to a network address should be a deliberate act, not an accident of the default config |
| `port` | `8080` | |
| `origin_allowlist` | `["http://localhost:8080"]` | Browser origins allowed to call state-changing routes and open the event WebSocket. Same-origin does not stop a cross-origin POST and does not apply to WebSockets at all, so both are checked explicitly. `"*"` disables the check |
| `auth_subject_header` | `X-Auth-Subject` | The header your authenticating proxy sets. Recorded in the audit log as the acting principal. Informational only: it is never an authorization input |

### llm

```yaml
llm:
  provider: openai_compat        # openai_compat | anthropic | mock
  base_url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
  api_key: ${VAHUB_LLM_API_KEY}
  model: anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku
  temperature: 0.2
  max_tokens: 1024
  request_timeout_s: 60
  system_prompt: null
```

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `provider` | `mock` | `mock` is a keyword stub that needs no credentials. It is not language understanding; it exists so the whole loop can be exercised in tests |
| `base_url` | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works: OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, Ollama, llama.cpp |
| `api_key` | none | Use a reference, not a literal |
| `model` | `mock` | |
| `temperature` | `0.2` | Range 0 to 2. Low, because this model is choosing actions, not writing prose |
| `max_tokens` | `1024` | Per response |
| `request_timeout_s` | `60` | |
| `system_prompt` | none | Replaces the built-in prompt. The built-in one tells the model that tool results are data and never instructions; if you replace it, keep that sentence |

## Choosing a model without editing the file

`llm`, `speech.stt` and `speech.tts` are the three sections an admin can also set from the web
interface, under Settings, Models. It is the same set of fields, and the same meanings; what changes is
where the value comes from.

* Only these fields can be set there: provider, server, model, API key, and additionally temperature and
  max tokens for `llm`, and voice for `tts`. Anything else stays a file-only setting.
* A value set in the UI is stored in the hub's database and takes precedence over the file. Clearing it
  ("Use the config file") deletes the stored value, and the file's value applies again on the spot.
* An API key set this way is stored the way a module's token is: scoped, never returned to the browser,
  and redacted in the audit log. The page can tell you a key is set; it cannot tell you what it is.
* Changing any of it rebuilds the adapters immediately. A conversation already in flight finishes on the
  model it started with; the next message uses the new one. There is no restart.
* It is admin-only, because it spends money and holds a credential. The server refuses it for anyone
  else rather than merely hiding the page.
* It grants the assistant nothing. Which tools may be called is still decided by `policy`, which is
  file-and-CLI only. Changing the model changes who answers, not what may be done.

This is what makes a self-hosted speech stack practical: point `speech.stt` at a Whisper server on your
own machine and `speech.tts` at a local voice, without a text editor or a restart. Anything that speaks
the OpenAI shape works, which most of them do.

### budgets

```yaml
budgets:
  iterations_per_turn: 8
  tool_result_bytes: 16384
  tokens_per_turn: 20000
  tokens_per_day: null
  wall_clock_text_s: 30
  wall_clock_voice_s: 8
```

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `iterations_per_turn` | `8` | Model calls per turn, 1 to 100 |
| `tool_result_bytes` | `16384` | Each tool result is truncated to this before re-entering the context. An iteration cap alone does not bound cost: one unfiltered result can dwarf a whole conversation |
| `tokens_per_turn` | `20000` | 0 disables the check |
| `tokens_per_day` | none | When set and reached, the agent stops answering until midnight in `hub.timezone`. Scheduled routines keep running, because they use no tokens |
| `wall_clock_text_s` | `30` | Deadline for a typed turn |
| `wall_clock_voice_s` | `8` | Deadline for a spoken turn. Shorter, because a spoken reply that arrives late is worse than one that admits it gave up |

Token accounting is best effort and comes from the provider's reported usage.

### speech

```yaml
speech:
  stt:
    provider: browser        # browser | openai_compat | none
    base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
    api_key: ${VAHUB_STT_API_KEY}
    model: whisper-1
    request_timeout_s: 60
  tts:
    provider: browser        # browser | openai_compat | none
    base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
    api_key: ${VAHUB_TTS_API_KEY}
    model: tts-1
    voice: alloy
    request_timeout_s: 60
```

`browser` means the client does the work locally: the browser transcribes speech and speaks the reply,
no credentials are needed and no audio leaves the machine. `openai_compat` posts audio to a
Whisper-style endpoint and requests speech from a `/audio/speech` endpoint. `none` disables that
direction entirely.

### policy

The gate. Covered in depth in [security.md](security.md); this is the syntax.

```yaml
policy:
  default: deny
  confirm_ttl_s: 60

  principals:
    agent:     { confirm: [destructive], deny: [] }
    scheduler: { confirm: [], deny: ["*lock*", "*unlock*", "*delete*"] }
    user:      { confirm: [], deny: [] }

  rules:
    time.get_current_time:
      class: read
      constraints:
        tz: { max_len: 64 }

    homeassistant.light_turn_on:
      class: write
      constraints:
        entity_id:      { matches: "^light\\.(kitchen|bedroom|hall)$", max_len: 64 }
        brightness_pct: { range: [1, 100] }

    homeassistant.lock_unlock:
      class: destructive
      constraints:
        entity_id: { in: ["lock.front_door", "lock.garage"] }
```

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `default` | `deny` | `allow` with no rules is rejected at load: it would hand the model unrestricted control |
| `confirm_ttl_s` | `60` | How long a pending destructive confirmation stays valid |
| `principals` | empty | Who is acting. Known principals are `agent`, `scheduler`, and the subject that confirms a pending call. An unlisted principal gets the empty default: no confirmations required, nothing denied by name, and still subject to `default: deny` |
| `rules` | empty | Keyed by `module.tool` |

A principal has two lists. `confirm` names tool classes that require out-of-band confirmation before
they run. `deny` holds glob patterns matched against `module.tool`, which is how you remove a whole
family of tools from one actor without touching the rules.

A rule has a `class` (`read`, `write`, or `destructive`) and a `constraints` map, one entry per allowed
argument. Constraint types:

| Constraint | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `in: [...]` | The value must be one of these |
| `matches: "regex"` | The value must be a string, and the pattern must match the WHOLE value (re.fullmatch). `light\.[a-z_]+` allows `light.kitchen` but not `light.kitchen extra` or `xlight.kitchen`; you do not need `^`/`$` |
| `range: [min, max]` | Numeric, inclusive |
| `max_len: n` | Length of the value as text |

Several constraints on one argument all apply. An argument that appears in a call but has **no**
constraint entry is denied. That is the property that keeps a rule from aging into a hole as a module
grows new parameters, and it means read-only tools with arguments still need to list them.

A tool with no rule at all is denied under `default: deny`, and is also hidden from the model's catalog,
so it does not plan calls that would only die at the gate.

### schedules

```yaml
schedules:
  - id: morning
    cron: "30 6 * * 1-5"      # 06:30 on weekdays, in hub.timezone
    enabled: true
    steps:
      - module: homeassistant
        tool: light_turn_on
        args: { entity_id: light.bedroom, brightness_pct: 40 }
        timeout_s: 10
      - module: time
        tool: speak_current_time
```

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | required | Must be unique. A duplicate is a load error |
| `cron` | required | Five field crontab syntax, evaluated in `hub.timezone` |
| `enabled` | `true` | `false` keeps the definition without registering the job |
| `steps` | empty | Executed in order. A failing step aborts the rest of the routine |
| `steps[].timeout_s` | `10` | Per step |

Routines run as `principal: scheduler` and are subject to the gate like everything else. They involve no
model, so their cost is zero and their behaviour is fixed.

## Module configuration

Modules are not configured in `vahub.yaml`. Each installed module has its own manifest in
`hub.modules_dir`, written by `vahub module add`, which declares its command, its health and restart
parameters, the audit fields to redact, and the tools it offers. See
[writing-modules.md](writing-modules.md) for the full manifest.

Module credentials are environment variables, and a module only ever receives the keys its manifest
names in `config.required` and `config.optional`. There is no blanket pass-through of the hub's
environment, so a token belonging to one module is not visible to another. `vahub module add` reports
which keys a module needs and can record values for them at install time (`--set KEY=VALUE`, see
[cli.md](cli.md)). Otherwise supply them to the hub process itself, for example with an
`EnvironmentFile` in the systemd unit:

```ini
[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/etc/vahub/secrets.env   # 0600, owned by root
```

A module whose required keys are missing is discovered and shown by `vahub doctor` as `unconfigured`
instead of failing to spawn, so the reason is obvious.

A module's keys can also be set from the web interface (the Modules tab), for a hub you run entirely from
the browser. Those values are stored in the hub database, scoped to the one module, and never read back
to the browser: the UI shows which keys are set, not their values. The supervisor uses a stored value
only when the host environment does not already provide the key, so an exported `VAHUB_MOD_<NAME>_<KEY>`
or bare `<KEY>` still wins. Setting a key this way starts or restarts the module without a hub restart.

## Checking a change

```bash
vahub doctor          # validate the config and every installed manifest
```

Configuration is read once, at startup. Changing the file, including policy rules and schedules, takes
effect on restart.
